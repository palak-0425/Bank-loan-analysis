<p align="center">  This project explores U.S. bank loan data from 2021 using SQL for data transformation and Tableau for visualization. 
                  The goal is to uncover trends in loan applications, borrower behaviour and risk profiles to support data-driven lending decisions.</p>
                                                                          
                                                                          
                                                                          
                                                                          
<p align="center"> A three-tier dashboard system was created to offer **progressive depth of analysis** — starting from a high-level summary, moving into regional and demographic patterns, 
                                                           and ending with detailed, filterable loan-level data. </p>
